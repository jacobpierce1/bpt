This directory contains tools for parsing BPT (beta-decay paul trap) data. 

ttree_to_bin takes in a root file generated by the BPT strip detectors and writes all the data in a manner in which the spectra measured on each strip detector pixel can be efficiently dealt with separately.

bpt_python contains python functions for handling the data generated by ttree_to_bin.
